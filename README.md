# Real-time Multilingual Tokenizer

During this project, I developed a real-time tokenizer that can effectively handle unpunctuated text. I was able to create a final model that not only punctuated the text but also accurately detected sentences in real-time. This achievement marked a significant milestone in the development of a real-time translator application.
